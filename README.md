Project Title: Predictive Model for Steel Tensile Strength Based on Composition Analysis

Description:

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the tensile strength of steel based on its chemical composition, providing a critical tool for material design and quality control in metallurgy and manufacturing. The model was trained on data containing various elements in steel compositions, including percentages of carbon, manganese, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, and vanadium, which significantly impact material properties.

Using techniques such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering, the project addressed data normalization, outlier detection, and identification of key predictive features. The model development involved comparing several algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with a focus on optimizing accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

The final model, selected for its ability to generalize and handle nonlinear relationships, achieved high predictive accuracy. Additionally, the project was extended into a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, where users can input steel compositions to receive real-time tensile strength predictions. This app can support real-world applications such as rapid material assessment and enhancing manufacturing efficiency.
